This project aims to bring an easy to use [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) themed datepicker to Ember.

## This addon is mid way through development and should not yet be used

## Installation

Install the ember-cli addon in your ember-cli project:

```
$ ember install ember-material-design-datepicker
```
This should also automatically create an scss file under `app/styles/app.scss` with `@import 'ember-material-design-datepicker';` and install `ember-cli-sass`.

Sass is required for this addon. There are a number of sass variables that can easily be overidden to change the default styling of Ember-material-design-datepicker.

### TODO Provide list or link to variables they can set

## Usage

### Options
TODO - May choose to auto gen using YUIDoc.

## Collaborating

### Styling
We use Eslint to enforce styling. We aim to match [Ember Styling Guide](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md) but this is a work in progress.
